### IMPORTANT NOTE
IF YOU ARE LISTED ON [HERE](https://github.com/VictiniX888/Illegal-Mod-Sites/blob/master/SITES.md), GO AWAY. I made this license to stop sites like you.

### Scope
This means that you’re free to pretty much do what you like with the the code (source) or compiled binaries (jar/zip/class files), including but not limited to:
* Download code or compiled binaries for personal use
* Put the code or compiled binaries into your product
* Fork the repository on github (if avalible)
* Compile the code
* Modify the code to: 
  * fix bugs 
  * add features 
  * fit better with your product
  * remove a problematic item
  * replace all item icons with cat pictures, because cats
* Use portions of the code as examples in a presentation
* Record portions of gameplay with the product (depending on the product in question) for display on YouTube or other video/media sites

The above usage is granted to you as long as this license remains intact for all original or derived code. YOU MUST include a copy of this license with the code, or provide a link to this document, just to make sure everyone's in the loop about this. You must also include a link to the original project you based yours on.

### Ownership
This licence specifically prohibits you from claiming the the product or compiled binaries are yours without permission from the previous author(s). 

### Non-Commercial Status
You are expressly prohibited from making or trying to make money from the product, derivatives of the product, compiled portions of the product, etc etc.

This license specifically prohibits you from using AdF.ly or AdF.ly clones (any "click past an ad before you can download" service) to make money or attempt to make money for clicks or downloads.

Specific exceptions to the non-commercial nature of this license are granted to any derivitive works of art. Here's some specific exemptions:
* If you make a cool tee-shirt design based off the product and want to sell that, it's completely ok. 
* Want to use the the product or compiled binaries as part of a charity event? Go ahead. 
* Make money from Let's Play videos or other "commentary" type uses, eg reviews or how-to videos/tutorials? No problem.

Ultimately, your work is your own. This license is designed to protect against jerks trying to make money off someone else's work. Any exemptions not listed here require permission from the code author.

### Damages
This license prohibits any attempt to hold the author liable for damages caused by usage of the product or compiled binaries. Bugs happen, so make backups (if necessary), and don't complain if things get corrupted.
